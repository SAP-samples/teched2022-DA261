# DA261 - SAP HANA Cloud Database Administration and Development

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session called DA261 - SAP HANA Cloud Database Administration and Development.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to the operations required for end-to-end administration and development of SAP HANA Cloud database instances using the tools offered in the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).  Attendees will learn how to accomplish administration tasks such as instance monitoring and security management, as well as development tasks such as creating native SAP HANA artifacts and analyzing their performance.  Part 1 will introduce the tools and deploy some sample tables and calculation views.  Part 2 will demonstrate how to further administer these deployed artifacts.


## Requirements

To complete this workshop, you need access to an SAP BTP account. You can access SAP HANA Cloud from within SAP BTP and you can use a trial, free tier,  or productive version of SAP HANA Cloud.  **This workshop assumes that you already have a SAP BTP account and SAP HANA Cloud database.**  If not, you can register for free at https://www.sap.com/cmp/td/sap-hana-cloud-trial.html.

In your SAP HANA Cloud account (trial or non-trial), perform the following steps:

1.	Enter the trial subaccount
2.	Enter the dev space
3.	Click SAP HANA Cloud from the left navigation bar
4.	Click the button Create Instance in the top right to invoke the Create Instance wizard
5.	Enter DEMO_HANA_DB for the instance name
6.	Enter and confirm your administrator password â€“ ***PLEASE REMEMBER IT!***
7.	Click the button Create Instance at the bottom

A new SAP HANA Cloud instance will be created, and this process will take approx. 25 minutes.  You may need to refresh the page to see the instance as "Running" (as opposed to "Creating").
